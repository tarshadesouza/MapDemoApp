# MapDemoApp

# Introduction 
Hey there thanks for taking a look at my coding test! Heres a few things to know about the way I have chosen to set up this project.

## Dependencies
- Alamofire version 5.2 pinned

#### A little info behind my choices of Libraries

-Alamofire: Likewise, usually in projects, I am used to using wrappers of Alamofire. And on the odd occasion URLSession. Its a well mainted Lib so Im not to worried about this decision.

For parsing I have chosen to use Codable and not any third party libraries.

## Flow & Architecture
### Design Pattern
This project is made using clean architecture in particular I am using a clean-swift design templated, I chose this mainly because I wanted to experiment more with the implications of clean-swift. I prefer VIPER as I find it a little difficult in clean-swift keeping the View clear from alot of business logic, however I do believe that there are some rather large advantages working with clean-swift and testing was one of them. I also chose XIB´s instead of storyboards because I feel they are far more maintainable when your working as a team and even sometimes alone. 

### Flow
Flow of this app is very simple. Upon the view loading it will look for the required objects and show them to you on an interactive map. The points on the map are color coordinated based on 'companyZoneID' and they all have detail information. 

## Tests
### XCUnitTest
I have written a total of 4 tests which gives me a total of 36% of test coverage. All the tests were geared towards making sure that business logic is behaving as it should. This way in the future if I change an important part of my business logic I should get a failed test.

As For the UITests, Im afraid I didn´t have enough time to do any. For developing I prefer to use Unit tests and a UITest is quite similar to a QA using Appium so for me I find that unit tests are more important for a reliable code base, I have also found that UITests take quite a long time to load and execute.

Thanks again for taking you time to look all of this over. And any feedback is welcome!
